# 🧑‍💻 User Onboarding & Offboarding Automation (Python + CSV)

This project simulates a real-world IT help desk scenario where new users are onboarded and departing users are offboarded using a simple Python script and a CSV file. The script logs actions with timestamps, generates email addresses, and stores a record of activity for auditing.

## 🔧 Features

- Automated onboarding/offboarding using CSV input
- Generates email addresses dynamically
- Logs all actions with timestamps
- Simple to customize and expand

## 🗂 Files

- `main.py` — the main script
- `users.csv` — list of users with actions (onboard/offboard)
- `logs/log.txt` — stores logs of all operations
- `README_code_explanation.txt` — beginner-friendly code breakdown
